# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Bootstrap-Portfolio 

Third week coding bootcamp challenge; creating a professional profile webpage implementing Bootstrap framework.

## Site Description

This is a webpage that could one day display my programming portfolio and contact details for prospective employers to see what I'm capable of and get in touch with me.

## What I Did

Recreated my professional portfolio website from last week using Bootstrap with additional CSS styling. Was interesting learning to modify Bootstrap components without the mysterious and all-powerful "Sass" I kept reading about. Will have to investigate this further at a later date! Still feel I have much to learn on the design front too.
